# MyToken

A Brief Synopsis of Use and Goals
MyToken is a Solidity smart contract that lets users mint and burn tokens and offers fundamental ERC20-like token capabilities.


## Synopsis

A smart contract called MyToken, built using Solidity, allows users to create and manage unique tokens on the Ethereum network. It has features for storing metadata like as the token's name, abbreviation, and total quantity in addition to minting new tokens and destroying current ones. This contract is a fundamental part of Ethereum tokenization initiatives.


## Getting Started
